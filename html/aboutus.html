            </div>
            <div class="row">
                The San Francisco Bay Area has always been a center for the maker movement; a center of creativity, innovation, and market disrupting inventions. On November 17th, 2017, a well used for-profit makerspace, TechShop, closed the doors on all 9 locations in the U.S. In the bay area it left 1,800 makers without a place to make. These innovators, hobbyists, students, and artists were out in the cold. That very day a group of customers from the Mid-Peninsula location formed the Facebook group Maker Orphans to connect the community and hold it together. Maker Orphans has now grown to 1,500 members from across the U.S.

Closer to home, we organized a series of public town hall meetings to discuss the future. The turnout was greater than we could have imagined. It became clear that the makers in our area would step up and create a new non-profit makerspace. Maker Nexus was born.

Moving to Los Angeles she worked for a wholesale art supplier while taking night classes in computer science, bookkeeping, and costume design at the Fashion Institute of LA. Nights were spent on costuming work for community theater and a small movie production company. After moving to San Jose she learned sculpting, metal smithing and lapidary, and volunteered with an art therapy program at the VA.</p>

Benefiting from my training in mechanical and electrical engineering, my avocation for over 30 years has been residential remodeling where, after ten major projects, I’ve developed expertise in carpentry and metal work as well as some skills in most every other aspect of construction. I believe that the skills one can learn from making things builds a sense of confidence, an innate ability to solve complex problems, and an appreciation for craft and teamwork. <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>
